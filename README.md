# ðŸª‘ Furniture Profit Dashboard (Python + Tableau)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Analyze profitability issues in the Furniture category of the Superstore dataset using Python for data preprocessing and Tableau for business intelligence visualization.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **High Sales, Low Profit**: Furniture sales are strong, but profitability is low, especially for categories like *Bookcases* and *Tables*.
- **Regional Disparity**: The *West* region leads in sales but has suboptimal profit margins.
- **Customer Segments**: *Consumer* segment dominates sales, but *Corporate* yields better profit margins.
- **Shipping Efficiency**: *Standard Class* shipping shows the highest loss margin compared to other shipping modes.
- **Discount Threshold**: Orders with a discount over 30% frequently result in negative profit.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Processing
Performed using Python (Pandas, Seaborn):
- Cleaned and converted date columns
- Extracted year/month for trend analysis
- Aggregated profit, sales, and discount metrics by region, category, shipping mode, etc.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
7 key charts created with Tableau:
1. **Sales vs. Profit by Sub-Category**
2. **Monthly Profit Trend**
3. **Profitability by Region**
4. **Profit by Customer Segment**
5. **Delivery Timeliness vs. Profit**
6. **Shipping Mode Impact**
7. **Discount vs. Profit Scatter**

All visualizations are integrated into one interactive dashboard layout.
